- ⚡ Fun fact: First time using Git Hub
The first program, written by Daniel Zambrano Juca, provides a method to obtain an activity and selectivity, relative to a standard Cu/ZnO(Al2O3 catalyst, in methanol production from CO2
from data including X,S, GHSV, T and P. (i.e. conversion, selectivity, gas hour space velocity, temperature and pressure)
